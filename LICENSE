PROJECT MICROBUG - REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION LICENSE
===================================================

Copyright (C) 2014 BBC.

The reference implementation is provided to assist you in your
pitch/proposal/ development process.  It is NOT intended as a basis for
ongoing development.

Improvements to the reference implementation are welcome, but can only be
made, and may only be accepted as per the license below:

  1 The reference implementation is confidential data, and is confidential
    as per the NDA.

  2 You may make local modifications which you may not share publically,
     and these remain under NDA


  3 Any changes/bug fixes you make are gratefully accepted. If you wish to
    contribute these back, you have the following 2 options:

    a Grant of an Apache 2 license over the work to the BBC, with a specific
      grant allow the apache 2 code to interoperate with any GPL element
      that we use. (This is the preferred option)

    b Copyright assignment to the BBC, including the right to use any
      embodiment of patented inventions, within the scope of the microbug
      project only. (The apache 2 license contains this clause)

  4 We (The BBC) do NOT undertake to accept, merge, review or feedback any
     of your changes/perceived bug fixes into the reference implementation,
     though provide.  However, items in section 3 are specifically designed
     to enable that to happen, and where practical, possible and in keeping
     with the editorial aspirations, we would be grateful to accept such
     patches.

     There would be no recompense for such patches beyond thanks.  If
     patches are provided under section 3, then this allows us to release
     the reference implementation - for example to prospective parters or as
     per the RFP as open source at a later point in time.

     If we do accept and/or merge any patches, we reserve the right to modify them
     to match the project, and also reserve the right to re-release the reference
     implementation at a later point in time.

  5 The reference implementation is a WORK IN PROGRESS. It covers most of
     the functional specification, and was used to create the functional
     spec.  However, in places the the reference implementation deviates
     from the functional spec.  In such cases, the functional spec is
     canonical, and over time the reference implementation will improve to
     match the spec.

    note the warning.
